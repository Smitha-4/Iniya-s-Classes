# Tuple Notes

## Definition

- A tuple is an ordered collection of values
- it is written in parantheses and separated by a comma
- Once create, we cant change the values of a tuple
- we can either count how many values are there in a tuple or find the index of a value
- tuples are used as keys in a dictionary. 
- you can also use tuple in functions in a return statement to return multiple values of the code. 
- there are only two functions used for tuples
    1. count() - couting the number of values in a tuple
    2. index() - to find the indexing number or the position of an element or a value.
